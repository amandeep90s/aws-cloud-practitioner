# Terminology from Software Development & Operations

Understanding key terms from software development and operations is essential for working in modern IT environments. Below are some important concepts:

---

## 1. DevOps

- A set of practices aimed at breaking down silos between developers and operators.
- Promotes collaboration, automation, and consistent delivery of software.

---

## 2. Enterprise Architecture (EA)

- Focuses on designing the structure of systems to achieve business goals.
- Provides blueprints for how systems should be built, including software concepts and end results.

---

## 3. Lift & Shift

- A migration method where applications are moved as-is from one environment (e.g., on-premises) to another (e.g., public cloud).
- Pros:
  - Quick migration with minimal changes to application code.
- Cons:
  - May result in higher costs or inefficiencies in the cloud.
- **Remediation**: Post-migration optimization is often required.

---

## 4. Workload

- Refers to an application or software system running on a computing platform.
- Example: A traditional website may have workloads like a web server, application server, and database server.

---

## 5. On-Premises (On-Prem)

- Refers to company-owned or controlled data center infrastructure.
- Differentiates from public cloud environments.
- Challenges: Adapting on-premises systems to work in the cloud.

---

## 6. Rightsizing

- Optimization technique to match workloads with appropriately sized virtual resources.
- Goal: Minimize waste and reduce costs.
- Requires ongoing technology oversight.

---

## 7. Agile

- A project management methodology primarily used in software development.
- Features:
  - Tasks divided into short phases (sprints).
  - Frequent reassessment of priorities and plans.
  - Focus on incremental development, starting with a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** and enhancing it over time.

These terms provide a foundation for understanding modern software development and operational practices.
