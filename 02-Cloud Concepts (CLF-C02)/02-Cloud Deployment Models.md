# Cloud Deployment Models

## Four Types of Models

1. **Public Cloud**: In this model, cloud resources like servers and storage are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider. These resources are delivered over the internet and shared among multiple users. It is cost-effective and easy to scale.

2. **Private Cloud**: This model is dedicated to a single organization. The cloud infrastructure can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider. It offers greater control, security, and customization but can be more expensive.

3. **Hybrid Cloud**: A combination of public and private clouds, this model allows data and applications to be shared between them. It provides flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency while maintaining control over sensitive data.

4. **Community Cloud**: This model is shared by multiple organizations with similar needs or goals. It is managed and used collaboratively, offering a balance between cost-sharing and customization.

## Public Cloud

The public cloud is a cloud computing model where services are provided over the internet by third-party providers. These services are available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. It is ideal for businesses looking for scalability and cost savings without managing physical infrastructure.

## Private Cloud

The private cloud is a cloud computing model dedicated to a single organization. It can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider. This model offers enhanced security, control, and customization, making it suitable for organizations with strict compliance or regulatory requirements. However, it typically involves higher costs due to the need for dedicated infrastructure and management.

## Hybrid Cloud

The hybrid cloud combines public and private cloud environments, allowing data and applications to move between them. This model provides the flexibility to optimize workloads, leveraging the scalability of the public cloud for less sensitive tasks while keeping critical data secure in the private cloud. It is ideal for businesses seeking a balance between cost-efficiency and control.

## Community Cloud

The community cloud is a shared cloud infrastructure designed for use by multiple organizations with common goals, policies, or compliance requirements. It is collaboratively managed and maintained, offering a middle ground between public and private clouds. This model is often used by industries like healthcare, education, or government agencies to share resources and reduce costs while maintaining a level of customization.
