## Key Points:

1. **Definition of Compute**:

   - Compute resources are the "brains" of applications, responsible for processing instructions.
   - Examples include physical servers with CPUs and RAM in a data center.

2. **AWS Compute Services**:

   - AWS offers a variety of compute services to meet different requirements.
   - Examples:
     - **EC2 Instances**: Virtual servers used continuously for long-term tasks.
     - **AWS Lambda**: Serverless functions that execute code for a few milliseconds in response to events.

3. **Flexibility**:
   - Compute resources can be consumed in varying quantities and durations.
   - The choice of compute service depends on business needs, ranging from high-performance, long-term tasks to short, event-driven executions.
