# Cloud Concepts

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is a remote, virtual pool of on-demand shared resources offering Compute, Storage, and Network services that can be rapidly deployed at scale.

- **Compute**: Processes workloads, including running applications and services.  
  _Example_: CPU, RAM.
- **Storage**: Saves data across a shared environment.  
  _Example_: NAS (Network Attached Storage), SAN (Storage Area Network).
- **Network**: Provides connectivity for resources to communicate.  
  _Example_: Router, Firewall.

## What is Virtualization?

Virtualization enables multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) to run on the same hardware.

- Each VM operates independently with its own OS and applications.
- VMs share underlying hardware resources via a **Hypervisor**.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduced capital and operating costs.
  - Less physical space required for servers.
  - Optimized resource utilization.

## Hypervisor

A hypervisor is software that creates and manages the virtualized environment, allowing multiple VMs to run on the same host.

- Ensures efficient sharing of hardware resources.
- Acts as an intermediary between VMs and hardware.
