# Cloud Concepts

## What is Cloud Computing?

- A remote virtual pool of on-demand shared resources offering Compute, Storage ad Network services that can be rapidly deployed at scale.
- Compute: Provide the brains to process your workload, including what's required to process and run requests from applications and services. Classic environment example: CPU, RAM.
- Storage: Allow you to save your data across a shared environment. Any object that allows to save your data is a storage resource. Classic environment example: NAS (Network Attached Storage), SAN (Storage Area Network)
- Network: Provide connectivity that allows other resources to communicate with each other. Classic environment example: Router, Firewall

## What is Virtualization?

- Allows the possibility of multiple VMs (Virtual Machines).
- Each VM runs a separate OS and apps.
- The VMs runs at the same time without being aware of each ohter's existence while sharing the underlying hardware resources.
- Requests from VM's --> Hypervisor: Ensures hardware resources are shared --> Hardware resources.
- Advantages: Reduced capital expenditure, Reduced operating cost, Less space required for server hardware, Optimization of resources and equipment.

## Hypervisor

- A piece of software used to create the virtualized environment. Allows multiple VM's to be installed at same host.
