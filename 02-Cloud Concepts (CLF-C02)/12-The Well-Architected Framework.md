# The Well-Architected Framework

The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides best practices and lessons learned to help customers design and improve their AWS architecture. It is organized around six pillars, each focusing on key aspects of cloud architecture:

---

## 1. Security

- Protect your data and systems.
- Implement measures like encryption, access controls, and monitoring.

---

## 2. Performance Efficiency

- Use compute resources efficiently.
- Minimize over-provisioning and optimize for fluctuating utilization.

---

## 3. Cost Optimization

- Eliminate unnecessary expenses.
- Focus on rightsizing, reserved instances, and efficient resource usage.

---

## 4. Operational Excellence

- Automate and monitor workloads to gain insights into day-to-day operations.
- Refine procedures to improve efficiency and reliability.

---

## 5. Sustainability

- Reduce energy consumption and environmental impact.
- Optimize resource utilization to support green initiatives.

---

## 6. Reliability

- Dynamically acquire compute resources to meet demand.
- Implement redundancy, backup, restore, and disaster recovery procedures.
- Use automation to mitigate disruptions like misconfigurations.

---

## Purpose of the Framework

- Helps assess and improve AWS architecture by asking structured questions around the six pillars.
- Encourages understanding of the business impact of design decisions.
- Provides references and best practices for consistent architecture evaluation.
