# Key Cloud Concepts

## On-Demand

Resources are provisioned almost instantly when needed, eliminating delays associated with traditional hardware setups.

## Scalability

Ability to scale resources:

- **Up and Down**: Adjust the power of an instance (e.g., CPU or memory).
- **In and Out**: Add or remove instances based on demand.

## Economy of Scale

Public cloud providers optimize and share resources across organizations, reducing costs for compute, storage, and networking.

## Flexibility and Elasticity

Resources can be adjusted as needed without long-term contracts, offering flexibility in design and usage.

## Growth

Cloud computing supports organizational growth by providing a wide range of services (e.g., compute, AI, machine learning) with minimal constraints.

## Utility-Based Metering

Pay only for what you use, similar to utility bills (e.g., electricity). Costs are incurred only when resources are active.

## Shared Infrastructure

Virtualization allows multiple tenants to share the same hardware, reducing physical hardware needs and associated costs.

## High Availability

Core services are replicated across geographic zones and regions, ensuring durability and availability without additional configuration.

## Security

Cloud providers adhere to high global security standards. The shared responsibility model ensures the provider secures the infrastructure, while users secure their applications and data.
